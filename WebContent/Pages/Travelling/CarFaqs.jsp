<TR><Td class=padd style='text-align:justify;color:navy;font:100 11px tahoma'><BR><B>What happens if I would like to keep the car for longer? </B><BR>
Just tell us prior to last day and we will make arrangments for you - failure to do this will leave you with a heavier bill than you anticipated.<BR><BR>
<B>What time does the vehicle have to be back? </b><br>
We run on a 24 hour rolling basis- this means that if you hire a car at 10.00 A.M, you will need to get the car returned by this time on the drop-off date. Penalities can be incurred for late return of a vehicle. <BR><BR>
<B>What happens if I met with an accident? </B><BR>
Grand Tour insurance will lower your excess amount payable in the event of an accident. The excess amount varies from vehicle to vehicle. <BR><BR>
<B>Will you charge the same for roundtrip and oneway trip?</B><Br>
No the charges are not the same. In case of roundtrip there is an extra charge on car hire. eg. if you hire a car in Delhi, but return it in chandigarh in that case extra amount of fee will be charged <br><BR>
<B>How I will be assured with car I hire from hcutravels? </B><Br>
All our cars from the most trusted and reliable companies in the world eg. Hertz, Avis, Alamo and Dollar. So you will be assured with car you hire. It will be safe and reliable <BR><BR>
